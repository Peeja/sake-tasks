## Installation

First, clone the sake-tasks repo:

	git clone git://github.com/drnic/sake-tasks.git

Or replace 'drnic' with your github username if you have forked the sake-tasks repo.

Then install the sake tasks (this step is repeatable, even if one or more tasks are already exist; that is, any pre-existing tasks with the same name will be overridden)

	rake install

To see your list of resulting tasks:

	sake -T
